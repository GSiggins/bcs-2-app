            With the idea of imparting programming 
            knowledge, Mr. Sandeep Jain, an IIT 
            Roorkee alumnus started a dream, 
            GeeksforGeeks. Whether programming 
            excites you or you feel stifled, 
            wondering how to prepare for interview 
            questions or how to ace data structures 
            and algorithms, GeeksforGeeks is a 
            one-stop solution. With every tick of 
            time, we are adding arrows in our quiver.
            From articles on various computer 
            science subjects to programming problems 
            for practice, from basic to premium courses,
            from technologies to entrance examinations, 
            we have been building ample content with 
            superior quality.
